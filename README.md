`CASE STUDY Ana:`

```
   Ana lives in a remote community in the Australian Outback called Barkdine
they are lacking water due to a prolonged drought period. She requests help to deal with
present and future drought situations. She's logged in to Freely-Org and has marked
"NEED for WATER" as an URGENT REQUEST.

   Peter has responded to Ana's request, he can remedy the communities need for water
because he has a large water tank of 115,000L capacity he is happy to donate to Ana's community.

   Peter requests transport to deliver the water tank.

   David has responded to Peter's request, he can help deliver the water tank on his truck.

   Melinda offers to fill the water tank once installed in Barcaldine with clean
drinkable water, because she has access to a truck with a cistern.

   Bruce and his heavy machinery company offers to bulldoze an area in Barcaldine to
establish 2 large dams for water catchment to help relief future droughts.

Ana changes the status from NEED to No-Longer-Needed. The case has been closed and archived.
Ana's community are a happy one, they now have sufficient water and storage for the present
and future droughts. And have build new connections with other wonderful people who care.

`CASE STUDY Sak:`

```
   Sak has been miserable for most of his life because he had problems 'fitting in', he never
felt integrated or at home in his culture/society. So he decides to leave with a few a friends
and establish a small community in a remote area, living of the land. 

Thanks to Freely-Org Sak was able to make contact with several individuals eager to help, 
some of which now also live in the wonderful community established by Sak and his friends. 

They have created gardens, forests, water harvesters, and a community workshop powered on solar 
and wind energies.

   Sack's growing community is now completely self reliant, sustainable and independent
living entirely of the land, continuously creating abundance, thanks to permacultre principles.

   They even speak a "non-bloated" English language, where they have purged many terms which
have no place in this community, such as all 'fictional terms' like legal terms, political terms,
government terms, they don't even have use for money.
